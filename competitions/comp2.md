### MABe 2022 - Behavioral Representation Learning  
**Placement:** 2nd Place (\$2000 prize)

This competition, focused on multi-agent behavior modeling, involved learning representations from video and trajectory data of interacting animals. The goal was to produce embeddings that captured both individual and group dynamics, evaluated by their ability to generalize across a range of downstream behavior analysis tasks.

**Tags:** Multi-agent behavior, Representation learning, Animal tracking, Behavioral embeddings
